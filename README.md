# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting Titanic survivors using the famous **"Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster"** dataset from Kaggle.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that determines whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, and other personal details.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Train Dataset:** `train.csv` (includes passenger details and survival labels)
- **Test Dataset:** `test.csv` (includes passenger details, survival labels to be predicted)
- **Submission Format:** `submission.csv` (must contain `PassengerId` and `Survived` columns)

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy for data preprocessing
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization

## 📊 Model Training
The project involves training various classification models, such as:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks (Optional)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DazzlerByte/titanic-survival-prediction.git
